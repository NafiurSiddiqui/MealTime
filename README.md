# React-Meal

Practice project made with basic react concept until this point of the course.

## Things I have learned to use

- useReducer hook
- context API
- components composition
- useRef

## Things I have added

- styling
- mobile responsiveness
- changed ctx provider
- added resetHandler to the context
- passed props from child to parent
- added components like successMessage, orderBox
- placed a complete cycle of order placement
- set the state to initial state upon order placment.
- some smooth transition
- compressed hero image
- added firebase hosting

NOTE: This is just a practice project. I can enhance it with other state management library, put amazing animations, and 
add a backend and so on, to make it quite rich! I am not doing that since I am looking for real world experience with react and work on real projects.
